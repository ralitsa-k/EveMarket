Trying to create the dashboard showing group types and number of orders per region. 
Starting with downloading historical data to Docker using an example from the website containing the data. 
Currently the full 2024 data will be downloaded to Docker volume eve-hist-data 
This should then be loaded into python and aggregated. 
Plots will be created and added to a dash plotly interface. 

(Maybe a javascript website would help with react in the future)
