Buy best ships across the universe

TO DO

Create a dashboard (not in dash, but maybe in javascript or django) showing prices of main ships across regions.
Do machine larning after EDA to improve decision-making when buying ships in differnt regions, 
maybe using historical prices (best time, timefrequency), region safety, ship strength. 

Optimise ship strength given region safety contraints.
